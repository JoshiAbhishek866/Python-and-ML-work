'''
to define function we use def 
eg def print(data):
   print("The name is :" + data)
=> print(Cameroon):
   => "The name is : Cameroon"
eg. def area_trianglr(base,height):
     return base8height/2
     
 # in python // or double slash is called floor division of the number , and it is essentially used for taking the integer part of division( Eg 5//2 = 2 ) 
 
eg def function convert_sec(sec):
    hr=sec//3600
    min=(sec-hr*36000//60
    remaining_min=sec-hr*3600-min*60
    return hr,min,remaining_min
 => hr,sec,remaining_sec=convert_sec(5000)     # as we know that fun will return 3 values , 3 variables are there for assignment of value. 
    print( hr,sec,remaining_sec)
     => 1  23 20 
    
 # none datatype in python is used to indicate that things are empty or they doesnt return anything  
  eg of none result= print(Camerron)
     print(result)
     => none
   
 # boolean values has 2 results true or false
 
=> conditions statements in python
   def hint(username)
      if len(username)<3:   # mindwell, : or colon is used after conditional statements in if
         print("Invalid username")
      elif len(username)>15:      # mindwell, : or colon is used after conditional statements in elif
         print("invalid")
      else :                        # mindwell, : or colon is used just after else 
         print("valid username")
